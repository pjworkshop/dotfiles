# My Dotfiles
Configs & builds I use every day.

#### dwm ####
My build of [Suckless DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/) using unicode glyphs from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet) & colors based on my terminal scheme.


#### slstatus ####
The [status bar](https://tools.suckless.org/slstatus/) I use, configured to show CPU/RAM usage, free disk space, internet, battery, date & time, for my laptop. This also uses icons from Font Awesome.


#### st ####
My build of [Simple Terminal](https://st.suckless.org/). Work in progress due to problems with patches that I need to fix. Still very usable for the most part. My color scheme is a modified version of [google.dark](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell/blob/master/scripts/base16-google-dark.sh) with better highlighted colors.

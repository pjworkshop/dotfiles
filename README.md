# My Dotfiles
Configs & builds I use every day.

# dwm
My build of Suckless DWM using unicode glyphs from https://fontawesome.com/cheatsheet & colors based on my terminal scheme.
.config/dwm/

# slstatus
The status bar I use, configured to show CPU/RAM usage, free disk space, internet, battery, date & time, for my laptop. This also uses icons from Font Awesome.
.config/slstatus

# st
My config of Simple Terminal. Work in progress due to problems with patches that I need to fix. Still very usable for the most part. My color scheme is a modified version of Google Dark with better highlighted colors.
